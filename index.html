                        <p>
                            Attraction of investments is one of the major factors of successful development of business.

                        <h4>BASIC METHODS <span class="text-uppercase margin-l-20"></span></h4>
                        <p>
                            Attraction of investments is carried out in the basic two methods: or through share buying in an authorised capital stock, or through debt decor. In case of the former the investor becomes the shareholder and the co-owner of the company, in the second - the creditor. Sometimes simply use the loan agreement that allows to avoid licensing and does not get under treatment of banking. Financial and strategic investors carry out investments in the first method - through buying of a share or enterprise shares. Financial investors carry out an investment of money for a certain space of time, 4-5 years are routine, and consider already taken place companies. The main objective of the financial investor - to minimise scratches at certain level of yield, and after the lapse of the financing period - to sell the share, but is more narrow for other money. The size of a share in an authorised capital stock has no crucial importance for the financial investor. The strategic investor, opposite to aspire to receive the maximum share in business. As a rule strategic investors aspire to participate actively in management of the company and term of their sharing is limited to nothing. Strategic investors act as partners in business and frequently the company involving the investments and the company of the strategic investor closely related.

                        <h4>LONG CREDITS AND BOND ISSUE <span class="text-uppercase margin-l-20"></span></h4>
                        <p>
                            Attraction of investments through debt financing occurs by reception of long credits and bond issue. The bond market is not too developed yet, and long credits in bank not too simply to receive, to especially beginning business. Banks prefer to finance the stable and predicted companies which have developed in the market and do not attend to venture financing. Therefore at the initial stage attraction of investments with individual share in a company capital more approaches. And when the company will rise on feet, it is possible to manufacture shares or bonds. Venture investments represent a method of attraction of investments for the big term without guarantors and the lien. The private investors, ready to place own money in the design which has pleasant to them attend to venture investments. Many large companies began the business with venture investments. Venture investors like to risk, but also return from venture investments should be huge. Therefore venture investors actively participate in a business management.

                        <h4>TRADE <span class="text-uppercase margin-l-20"></span></h4>
                        <p>
                            Trade in shares basically occurs at stock exchanges. To purchase or sell shares it is possible by means of the broker who is rendering service on a capital market. The broker represents itself as the intermediary at trade in shares and other securities. The investor entrusts with the broker to purchase or sell shares at exchange, and that in turn reports on fulfilment of bargains. Trade in shares occurs by means of electronic trading platforms.
                            Trade in shares at exchange has a high share of risks as in itself investments into shares are subject to high scratches. Not the professional player on equity market can lose all money. To reduce a share of risks at trade in the shares, many make the competent investment portfolio containing the shares of the various companies with a different degree of risk. Routinely, the above profit at trade in shares, the above and scratches on them. Therefore much 5 companies recommend to buy shares at least. Some investors and speculators on fast-growing shares earn on 1000 % annual.
                            At successful trade in shares the investor secures the profit, from which it is necessary to pay the tax to the income. The income of trade in shares is defined by a difference between initial investments into purchase of securities and the received income of stock trading minus costs for broker service and services of the keeper of securities. At trade in shares investors use different strategy. The most favourable is long-term strategy when shares are purchased on time wide interval - one - two years. Especially when the market constantly grows. Thus it is not required the highest qualification and constant keeping track of by share quotations. The stock value constantly grows in short-term prospect or drops, but in the long-term long-term growth is observed. The only thing, not at all is a spare cash which can be enclosed on couple of years in the share and not to use them. Those who use short-term strategy at trade in shares - buy shares at the moment of droop in the market on a low price and sell shares during the moment when the market is on lifting and the stock value is high.
                            Recently it is possible to trade in shares on equity markets through the Internet. It is enough to place money for electronic exchange and by means of modern technologies it is possible to attend to trade in shares.
