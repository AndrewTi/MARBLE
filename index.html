                        <h4>BASIC METHODS <span class="text-uppercase margin-l-20"></span></h4>
                        <p>
                            Attraction of investments is carried out in the basic two methods: or through share buying in an authorised capital stock, or through debt decor. In case of the former the investor becomes the shareholder and the co-owner of the company, in the second - the creditor. Sometimes simply use the loan agreement that allows to avoid licensing and does not get under treatment of banking. Financial and strategic investors carry out investments in the first method - through buying of a share or enterprise shares. Financial investors carry out an investment of money for a certain space of time, 4-5 years are routine, and consider already taken place companies. The main objective of the financial investor - to minimise scratches at certain level of yield, and after the lapse of the financing period - to sell the share, but is more narrow for other money. The size of a share in an authorised capital stock has no crucial importance for the financial investor. The strategic investor, opposite to aspire to receive the maximum share in business. As a rule strategic investors aspire to participate actively in management of the company and term of their sharing is limited to nothing. Strategic investors act as partners in business and frequently the company involving the investments and the company of the strategic investor closely related.

                        <h4>LONG CREDITS AND BOND ISSUE <span class="text-uppercase margin-l-20"></span></h4>
                        <p>
                            Attraction of investments through debt financing occurs by reception of long credits and bond issue. The bond market is not too developed yet, and long credits in bank not too simply to receive, to especially beginning business. Banks prefer to finance the stable and predicted companies which have developed in the market and do not attend to venture financing. Therefore at the initial stage attraction of investments with individual share in a company capital more approaches. And when the company will rise on feet, it is possible to manufacture shares or bonds. Venture investments represent a method of attraction of investments for the big term without guarantors and the lien. The private investors, ready to place own money in the design which has pleasant to them attend to venture investments. Many large companies began the business with venture investments. Venture investors like to risk, but also return from venture investments should be huge. Therefore venture investors actively participate in a business management.

                            Trade in shares at exchange has a high share of risks as in itself investments into shares are subject to high scratches. Not the professional player on equity market can lose all money. To reduce a share of risks at trade in the shares, many make the competent investment portfolio containing the shares of the various companies with a different degree of risk. Routinely, the above profit at trade in shares, the above and scratches on them. Therefore much 5 companies recommend to buy shares at least. Some investors and speculators on fast-growing shares earn on 1000 % annual.
                            At successful trade in shares the investor secures the profit, from which it is necessary to pay the tax to the income. The income of trade in shares is defined by a difference between initial investments into purchase of securities and the received income of stock trading minus costs for broker service and services of the keeper of securities. At trade in shares investors use different strategy. The most favourable is long-term strategy when shares are purchased on time wide interval - one - two years. Especially when the market constantly grows. Thus it is not required the highest qualification and constant keeping track of by share quotations. The stock value constantly grows in short-term prospect or drops, but in the long-term long-term growth is observed. The only thing, not at all is a spare cash which can be enclosed on couple of years in the share and not to use them. Those who use short-term strategy at trade in shares - buy shares at the moment of droop in the market on a low price and sell shares during the moment when the market is on lifting and the stock value is high.
                            Recently it is possible to trade in shares on equity markets through the Internet. It is enough to place money for electronic exchange and by means of modern technologies it is possible to attend to trade in shares.

                        <h4>TEXTILES AND CLOTHING<span class="text-uppercase margin-l-20"></span></h4>
                        <p>
                            Textiles and clothing are among the most traded goods in the global economy and the EU dominates high quality markets.<br/><br/>

                            After China, the EU is the world’s second largest exporter of textile products with 31% including intra-EU trade. Excluding intra-EU trade, in 2010 the EU exported €33.8billion worth of textiles and clothing products and continues to dominate global markets for up-market and high quality textiles and clothing. Switzerland is our first export market (12.3%), USA has become the second export market of EU textile and clothing (T/C) products with 10.0% of total exports, followed by Russia (9.4%), Turkey (6.8%) and Tunisia (4.9%). In terms of value, the EU’s main suppliers in 2010 were China (41.8%), followed by Turkey (13.3%), India (7.8%), Bangladesh (7.2%) and Tunisia (3.1%)
                            The focus of the European Commission’s work in the textile and clothing sector is embedded in the framework of the Market Access Strategy relaunched in 2007. The foremost a aim is to remove barriers to European textile exports in growing markets abroad, opening opportunities for the European textile and clothing sector to enter public procurement services, ensure a fair and equal treatment with regard to IRP protection and fighting counterfeiting, which is highly damaging for EU textile and clothing producers. In the framework of the Market Access Strategy, early 2009 the Market Access Working Group was created dedicated to market access problems in the textile and clothing field. This working group presents a joint forum for economic operators, Member States and the Commission to work together towards the removal of barriers raised in third countries. Meetings take place since 2009 on a regular basis (approximately 3 times per year). This working group is a forum for all actors involved to discuss and exchange information on concrete market access barriers faced by the T/C sector. Problems relating to the supply of raw materials have arisen lately in T/C sector. The EU addresses these problems in the framework of its Raw Material Initiative. In February 2011, the Commission endorsed a Communication in this respect relating to challenges in commodity markets and raw materials.<br/><br/>

                            For many decades, the textiles and clothing sectors were a notable exception to the progressive liberalization of trade in manufactured goods. Since beginning of 2009 trade in textiles and clothing is fully liberalized and there are no longer any quantitative restrictions in the EU on textile and clothing exports including imports originating in China. Because of this liberalization, China has become the EU’s largest provider of textiles and clothing, and continues to capture market share in Europe, understandably a higher increase can be detected in recently liberalised categories, from other traditional providers in Asia.<br/><br/>

                            As with textiles and clothing, EU footwear exporters continue to face obstacles to exports in many markets, both in the form of high tariffs and non-tariff barriers. The footwear sector also suffers from the impact of counterfeiting and piracy.<br/><br/>

                            On the European market, EU producers face strong competition from low priced imports. Anti-dumping measures put in place since 2006 have been extended in December 2009 in order to counter unfair competition from China and Vietnam. An additional challenge for EU footwear producers is ensuring a steady and open supply of raw materials. The leather goods sector is widely affected by export taxes and export restrictions. Because the price of raw materials can be between 30 and 50% of the cost of production in this sector, barriers that raise the costs of raw materials can pose a serious problem. The EU addresses these problems in the framework of its Raw Material Initiative. In February 2011, the Commission endorsed in this respect a Communication relating to challenges in commodity markets and raw materials. Trade wise, we address these problems in our bilateral trade negotiations with raw material-exporting countries and in our Market access partnership.<br/>

                        <h4>FOOD <span class="text-uppercase margin-l-20"></span></h4>
                        <p>
                            Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.
                            Some countries list a legal definition of food, often referring them with the word foodstuff. These countries list food as any item that is to be processed, partially processed, or unprocessed for consumption. The listing of items included as food include any substance intended to be, or reasonably expected to be, ingested by humans. In addition to these foodstuffs, drink, chewing gum, water, or other items processed into said food items are part of the legal definition of food. Items not included in the legal definition of food include animal feed, live animals (unless being prepared for sale in a market), plants prior to harvesting, medicinal products, cosmetics, tobacco and tobacco products, narcotic or psychotropic substances, and residues and contaminants.
                            Historically, people secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry.<br/><br/>
                            Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council. They address issues such as sustainability, biological diversity, climate change, nutritional economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food.<br/><br/>
                            The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the "right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food", as well as the "fundamental right to be free from hunger".<br/><br/>
                            The Food Industry is a complex, global collective of diverse businesses that supply most of the food consumed by the world population. Only subsistence farmers, those who survive on what they grow, and hunter-gatherers can be considered outside of the scope of the modern food industry.<br/><br/>

                            The food Industry includes:

                        <h4>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT & WEB ADVERTISING <span class="text-uppercase margin-l-20"></span></h4>
                        <p>
                            Software development is the process of computer programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications and frameworks resulting in a software product. Software development is a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes in a planned and structured process.[1] Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.[2]
                            Software can be developed for a variety of purposes, the three most common being to meet specific needs of a specific client/business (the case with custom software), to meet a perceived need of some set of potential users (the case with commercial and open source software), or for personal use (e.g. a scientist may write software to automate a mundane task). Embedded software development, that is, the development of embedded software such as used for controlling consumer products, requires the development process to be integrated with the development of the controlled physical product. System software underlies applications and the programming process itself, and is often developed separately.<br/><br/>
                            The need for better quality control of the software development process has given rise to the discipline of software engineering, which aims to apply the systematic approach exemplified in the engineering paradigm to the process of software development.<br/><br/>
                            There are many approaches to software project management, known as software development life cycle models, methodologies, processes, or models. The waterfall model is a traditional version, contrasted with the more recent innovation of agile software development.<br/><br/>
                            Online advertising, also called online marketing or Internet advertising or web advertising, is a form of marketing and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers. Consumers view online advertising as an unwanted distraction with few benefits and have increasingly turned to ad blocking for a variety of reasons.<br/><br/>
                            It includes email marketing, search engine marketing (SEM), social media marketing, many types of display advertising (including web banner advertising), and mobile advertising. Like other advertising media, online advertising frequently involves both a publisher, who integrates advertisements into its online content, and an advertiser, who provides the advertisements to be displayed on the publisher's content.

                            Building material is any material which is used for construction purposes. Many naturally occurring substances, such as clay, rocks, sand, and wood, even twigs and leaves, have been used to construct buildings. Apart from naturally occurring materials, many man-made products are in use, some more and some less synthetic. The manufacture of building materials is an established industry in many countries and the use of these materials is typically segmented into specific specialty trades, such as carpentry, insulation, plumbing, and roofing work. They provide the make-up of habitats and structures including homes.<br/><br/>
                            The initial economic cost of building materials is the purchase price. This is often what governs decision making about what materials to use. Sometimes people take into consideration the energy savings or durability of the materials and see the value of paying a higher initial cost in return for a lower lifetime cost. For example, an asphalt shingle roof costs less than a metal roof to install, but the metal roof will last longer so the lifetime cost is less per year. Some materials may require more care than others, maintaining costs specific to some materials may also influence the final decision. Risks when considering lifetime cost of a material is if the building is damaged such as by fire or wind, or if the material is not as durable as advertised. The cost of materials should be taken into consideration to bear the risk to buy combustive materials to enlarge the lifetime. It is said that, 'if it must be done, it must be done well'.<br/><br/>
                            In the market place the term "building products" often refers to ready-made particles/sections, made from various materials, that are fitted in architectural hardware and decorative hardware parts of a building. The list of building products excludes the building materials used to construct the building architecture and supporting fixtures, like windows, doors, cabinets, etc. Building products, rather, support and make building materials work in a modular fashion.<br/><br/>
                            "Building products" may also refer to items used to put such hardware together, such as caulking, glues, paint, and anything else bought for the purpose of constructing a building.
